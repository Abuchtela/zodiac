# Glossary of terms

Here is a list of terms that you’ll see the Exit App tutorial use that you can refer back to if any are unclear.

* **Zodiac Exit**: a Zodiac pattern that allows members to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's (Safe or other account's) ERC-20 and native digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's rageQuit() function.

* **Zodiac Exit Mod**: a Zodiac module that can be equipped on a Safe account using the Zodiac App, or equipped on another compatible web3 account.

* **Exit App**: an application that provides members a friendly interface to redeem a designated token from a Safe equipped with the Exit Module.

* **Redeemable assets**: an avatar’s designated fungible or non-fungible tokens that an exiting member's can be redeem for an avatar’s claimable assets.

* **Claimable assets**: an avatar’s assets that an exiting member can claim in exchange for the redeemable asset.

* **Circulating supply**: the dynamically calculated number of tokens available and circulating in the market (not to be confused with max supply or total supply).

* **Safe**: a web3 avatar or programmable account with multi-signature functionality (a.k.a. a Gnosis Safe).
