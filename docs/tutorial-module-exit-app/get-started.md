## About the Zodiac Exit App

This app works in companion with the [Zodiac Exit Module](/zodiac/tutorial-module-exit-app).

The Exit App provides a friendly interface to redeem a designated token for a proportional share of an avatar's (Safe or other accountâ€™s) ERC-20 and native digital assets, similar to Moloch DAO's rageQuit() function. With the Exit App, members can even exit by redeeming an NFT (ERC-721) they hold.

This tutorial is for using the standalone Exit App site or the Exit App available as a Safe App.

Note: The Exit App can only be used with Safes equipped with the Zodiac Exit Module. Click here for more information on the Exit Module.

## Setup a Gnosis Safe

If you've already set up a Gnosis Safe you'd like to use for this tutorial, skip to the next step below.

If not, check out the Gnosis Safe Help Center. The [Create a Safe](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3876461-create-a-safe) tutorial will walk you through the full process of creating a new Gnosis Safe account in just 60 seconds.

Note that for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be using a Gnosis Safe deployed on the Rinkeby testnetwork. You can create a Gnosis Safe on Rinkeby at [http://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io](http://rinkeby.gnosis-safe.io/).

## Navigate to the Zodiac App

There are two ways to find the Exit App.

* **Standalone version**: If you are a member exiting with an web3 wallet, visit https://exit.gnosisguild.org/. Using the standalone version of the Exit App will be the most common.

* **Safe Apps version**: If you are a member exiting a Safe while using a Safe account to store your redeemable assets, find the Exit App through the Safe Apps list in your Gnosis Safe. (Instructions: On your Gnosis Safe's left menu, click the <code>APPS</code> option. Here you'll find apps available through Gnosis Safe. Search or scroll until you find the Exit App.)
