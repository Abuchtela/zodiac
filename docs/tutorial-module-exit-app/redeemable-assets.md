# Redeemable assets

Once your web3 wallet is connected, the Exit App will indicate which token(s) you can redeem for a share of the DAO's assets, as well as your balance and the token's market value. The process for selecting your token will be slightly different depending on whether you're exiting with an ERC-20 token or ERC-721 (NFT), both outlined below.

## Token Exit (ERC-20)

Enter the amount that you would like to redeem in the "Exit Amount" field in the left panel.

Then select or unselect the appropriate checkbox(es) under "Select assets to claim" in the right panel. This ensures you are redeeming your token for the intended digital asset(s) of your choice. 

Important Notes: 
* If you do not select any assets to claim, you will receive a proportional share of the Safe's native asset (ETH or something similar, depending on your network).
* You can claim other proportional assets in a separate transaction only if you have any remaining designated tokens.

Verify that the "Claimable Value" is correct.

In the example below, the account is exiting with 500 ALUM.

## NFT Exit (ERC-721)

If you are exiting the DAO by redeeming an NFT (ERC-721), you must select the intended NFT to redeem by using the dropdown menu under "Exit Token" in the left panel. 

Then click on the appropriate checkbox(es) under "Select assets to claim" in the right panel. This ensures you are redeeming your NFT for the intended digital asset of your choice.

Verify that the "Claimable Value" is correct.

Important Notes: 
* If you do not select any assets to claim, you will receive a proportional share of the Safe's native asset (ETH or something similar, depending on your network).
* You can claim other proportional assets in a separate transaction only if you have any remaining designated tokens.
* A Safeâ€™s assets are divided equally per NFT among an entire NFT collection. In the example above, the account is exiting with the WAND #5 NFT. Because the circulating supply is 3, the account can choose to claim 1/3 of the attached Safe's assets.
